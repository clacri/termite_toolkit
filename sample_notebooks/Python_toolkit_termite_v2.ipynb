    "input_text = \"The data in Table 2, Row 2 suggest that Telmisartan might be useful to prevent colon cancer (note that Clopidogrel is in both the Drug and Control arm, so we did not investigate Clopidogrel further). Recent cell-based studies reported that Telmisartan exerts anti-tumor effects by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Li et al., 2014; Pu, Zhu & Kong, 2016; Wu et al., 2016b). The algorithm presented here provides the first evidence from a randomized clinical trial indicating that Telmisartan may be viable as a repurposed prevention for colon cancer. Phylloquinone (Table 2, Row 4) is a vitamin (vitamin K1) supplement rather than a prescription drug. K vitamins + sorafenib induce apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cell lines (Wei, Wang & Carr, 2010). A prospective cohort analysis found that individuals who increased their intake of dietary phylloquinone might have a lower risk of cancer than those who did not (Juanola-Falgarona et al., 2014). The data from the randomized trial in Table 2 suggest that vitamin K1 might actually help prevent cancer (OR = 0.27, 95% CI [0.07–0.98]). The potential cancer prevention by vitamin K1 is especially intriguing because one can get more than 1,000% daily value of vitamin K1 by simply eating one cup of cooked kale or spinach (https://www.healthaliciousness.com/articles/food-sources-of-vitamin-k.php).\""
